Thmanyah Task 

## Description
In this taks I get home sections from Api and view them on run time based on type of content and type of view , 
also I implement search screen that search by search key and view result in the same way. 


## Challanges 
 1- working Content type and view type on run time.
 2- Time is too tight. 
 
 ## Technologies
The following technologies are used:
ViewModel to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
Dagger-hilt library to do dependency injection and reducing the boilerplate code.
Kotlin coroutines for doing work on the background thread and communicating to the main thread.
Jetpack Compose to simplify and accelerates UI development on Android by writing less code. It makes building Android UI faster and easier.
Retrofit library used to provide easy way to make api requests.

IF have more time I'd to do the following 
1- Enhance ui 
2- write more unit testing
3- write ui testing
4- make every feature in spearte project to make the app run in way Plug and play.
